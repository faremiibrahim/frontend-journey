    <h1> What is the <b>internet</b></h1>
    <p>a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. </p>
     
    <h2>How Does the Internet Work?</h2>
    <p>The internet delivers different types of information and media across networked devices. It operates using an internet protocol (IP) and a transport control protocol (TCP) packet routing network. Whenever you visit a website, your computer or mobile device requests the server using such protocols.</p> 
    <p>A server is where web pages are stored, and it functions similarly to the hard drive of a computer, except with far greater processing power. The server accesses the web page and delivers the right information to your computer whenever the request arrives. This is broadly the end-to-end user experience. Let us now look at the more technical details of how the internet works.</p>
