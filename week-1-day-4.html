                My journey into web development started out of curiosity about how websites are built. I wanted to move from just using websites to understanding how they actually work behind the scenes.
                <br>
                I began learning HTML and started building simple projects, from personal pages to basic blog layouts. Some parts were challenging at first, but with practice, things gradually started to make sense. Each small win motivated me to keep going and learn more.
                <br>
                This blog is a space where I document my progress, lessons learned, and growth as a web developer. I’m still learning every day, and I’m excited to continue improving and building better projects along the way.
